# SpotOpen Dashboard

The sole purpose of SpotOpen is to provide a simple way service providers to interact with their customers. The functions of this dashboard should reflect that.

## Setup Process

Upon signing up we want to fulfill the requirements of an active account in SpotOpen. These requirements are:

1. All providers at the place of business added;
2. company profile, completed with address;
3. provider profiles, completed with avatars;
2. customer profiles with contact methods ready for use; and,
3. a welcome message sent to customers.

The welcome message is important because it informs their customers of the transition in communication method and encourages them to download the SpotOpen mobile app.

## Customer Interactions Page

### Customer List

This list provides quick access to all of your customers. Filterable by name and online status. Each of the list items will indicate the online status and whether or not an unread message is contained.

### Customer Profile

#### v1

* Basic customer information found in the customer's entities
* Conversation window for chat
..*Indication of text response versus app response

#### v1.5

* Ability to merge customers

### New Customer

As a way to encourage adoption, SpotOpen needs to be capable of communicating to customers who are not users of the mobile app. This page will allow service providers to add customers and their contact methods, which they can use to interact with them on their customer profile.
